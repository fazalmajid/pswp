# Photoswipe gallery generator

## Introduction

pswp is a simple tool to create image galleries based on [PhotoSwipe v5](https://photoswipe.com).

The assumption is that you use ~~Lightroom~~ ON1 or some similar Digital Asset
Management (DAM) software to manage your photos, and want to do as little data
entry as possible outside the DAM.

## Building from source

You need [Go](https://golang.org) as a prerequisite.

Git clone or extract the source code from a tarball, then run `make`
